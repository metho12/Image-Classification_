# Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application

By the time you complete this notebook, you will have finished the last programming assignment of Week 4, and also the last programming assignment of Course 1! Go you! 

To build your cat/not-a-cat classifier, you'll use the functions from the previous assignment to build a deep network. Hopefully, you'll see an improvement in accuracy over your previous logistic regression implementation.  

**After this assignment you will be able to:**

- Build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and apply it to supervised learning

Let's get started!

## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader

Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:

1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.
2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.
3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.
4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.
5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.
